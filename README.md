Although we won't ever be better than C-3P0, we'll strive to support as many languages as possible. Please feel free to contribute a language with a pull request.

## Contributing
We keep two translation-files per locale, one for our front-end and one for all the other stuff. To add a locale, clone the repository, copy the default folder and rename it into the locale you are translating (e.g. nl-nl, be-nl, fr-fr, etc).
